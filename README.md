#Clojure Koans

##Description
My solutions to the [clojure koans](https://github.com/functional-koans/clojure-koans).

##How to Run
To complete the unsolved koans, clone the repo from the link above and work your way through.

To run the tests verifying that these solutions are complete, head to the `clojure-koans` directory and run `lein koan run`.

##Versions
These koans were completed with Leiningen 2.5.1 on Java 1.8 and Clojure 1.5.1

##Epilogue
Namaste
